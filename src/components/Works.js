              Welcome to my portfolio! While I'd love to showcase all of my past
              projects here, due to confidentiality agreements I am only able to
              showcase some. Though I can't reveal those specific projects, you
              can catch a glimpse of my capabilities on the homepage, as well as
              on GitHub and CodePen. Thank you for understanding!
            </p>
